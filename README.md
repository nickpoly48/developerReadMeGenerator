# developerReadMeGenerator

This project works through the command-line. Running index.js page dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username that the users inputs into the command line as well as ask a color profile the user wants to use. The application will be invoked with the following command:

node index.js

The PDF will be populated with the following:

    Profile image
    User name
    Links to the following:
    User location via Google Maps
    User GitHub profile
    User blog
    User bio
    Number of public repositories
    Number of followers
    Number of GitHub stars
    Number of users following

Business Context

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.
